      <p>
      I've been studying and working with Ruby on Rails part-time for 3&frac12;
      years, and full-time for almost a year. I've been a FTE and a consultant;
      worked on group and solo open-source projects; and have been helped
      along the way by
      <a href="https://github.com/mattknox">Matt Knox</a>'s rubyu classes,
      the <a href="http://bostonrb.org">Boston Ruby Group</a>'s
      monthly presentations, and every open source contributor everywhere.

      I made the unfortunate decision to learn some Rails and be clever by
      violating Rails conventions.  It's online only to
      provide a home for some of the stuff I've written elsewhere, and so I can
      keep writing about what I work on.

  How to learn Rails - guides and tutorials.
</h2>

<div class="post" id="post_1">
  <p>A friend learned some Ruby on Rails a few years ago (Rails 1.1).  Now he's returning to web development, and he wants to get back up to speed fast.  He asked me if I had any advice.  Turns out I did.</p>

<p>1. The Rails Tutorial.

<a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book" class="prominent-link">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book</a>

This is a free, online, complete book-length tutorial for learning rails.  It's pretty comprehensive for learning rails, and it's great.</p>

<p>It starts in with testing early, in the third chapter.  Obey the paradigm; do TDD (test-driven development)!  A huge strength of the book is that it integrates testing from the beginning, rather than relegating it to a late-chapter afterthought.  If a book presents testing in its own chapter, then it's not going to be effective in teaching the TDD philosophy.</p>

<p>RSpec is nearly universally-used in the workplace, in my experience.</p>

<p>2. You are using git, right?  Good source control is powerful<span id="jump"></span> and pretty liberating.  Git is the standard, and of course there's <a href="https://github.com" class="post-body">Github</a>, which is ridiculously useful for using, publishing, and collaborating on open-source code.</p>

<p>You might want to install an up-to-date version of git and download the HTML docs for that version at the same time.  As git gets updated, sometimes the online kernel.org documentation changes without notice.  (there's no note of what version each page refers to.)  I've been bitten before by relying on the online docs, which had been updated to reflect new functionality that my version of git didn't have.</p>

<p>git high-level doc:

<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html" class="prominent-link">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/everyday.html -- "Everyday GIT With 20 Commands Or So"</a></p>

<p>git books:

<a href="http://gitready.com" class="prominent-link">http://gitready.com</a>
<a href="http://progit.org" class="prominent-link">http://progit.org</a></p>

<p>git downloads:

<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.7.6.tar.bz2" class="prominent-link">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.7.6.tar.bz2</a>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-htmldocs-1.7.6.tar.bz2" class="prominent-link">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-htmldocs-1.7.6.tar.bz2</a></p>

<p>3. Install and use <a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/" class="post-body">rvm</a> as soon as possible.  I hated it & didn't get it at first.  But eventually I realized rvm's power.  It is fabulous.  The sooner you start using it, the sooner you will benefit, especially as you are on a learning curve and will probably be installing lots of gems.  rvm sandboxes your projects and makes everything MUCH easier to keep clean.</p>

<p>For example, if you upgrade ruby or rails for one project, or install or upgrade any gem (RSpec, CanCan, etc.), you might start seeing things fail on another project.  And it can get very painful to isolate which change (if any) is causing the problem.  With rvm, Rails 3's Gemfiles, and the bundler gem, you can isolate almost all of that per project: ruby version, bundler version, rails & gem versions, etc.</p>

<p>rvm:

<a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/" class="prominent-link">https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/</a>

Make sure you follow the complete install instructions, including the .profile specifics and the 'default ruby' detail.
After that, the rvm docs on the site are thorough, but irritatingly organized.  Oh well.  You can ask me rvm questions.</p>

<p>4. We (boston.rb) are archiving all our presentations that have been videoed -- we've been organizing this this week, still in progress today:

<a href="http://bostonrb.org/presentations" class="prominent-link">http://bostonrb.org/presentations</a>

You'll have to google our site, I guess, but we've had a lot of interesting presentations.</p>

<p>5. My friend Wyatt wrote a high-level guide, intended for someone with no prior development experience.  It's still a helpful blog post for the big concepts, like Rack -- and I especially like his 5 tips at the end:

<a href="http://techiferous.com/2010/07/roadmap-for-learning-rails/" class="prominent-link">http://techiferous.com/2010/07/roadmap-for-learning-rails/</a></p>

<p>6. Rails Bugmash is this weekend!  Consider asking around right away to see if anyone is hosting a get-together.  You'll get to test and verify pieces of the rails code itself.

<a href="https://github.com/rails/rails" class="prominent-link">https://github.com/rails/rails</a>

It's a good opportunity to see how real-world large-scale projects are managed & tested, and you'll be able to get pointers from smart people on how to get started.</p>

<p>7. Ryan Bates's Railscasts

<a href="http://railscasts.com" class="prominent-link">http://railscasts.com</a>

and the text & pictures version.

<a href="http://asciicasts.com" class="prominent-link">http://asciicasts.com</a></p>

<p>Additional screencasts that people have recommended (although not free) are at <a href="http://peepcode.com/" class="post-body">http://peepcode.com/</a> -- such as

<a href="http://peepcode.com/pages/rails-3-screencasts" class="prominent-link">http://peepcode.com/pages/rails-3-screencasts</a></p>

<p>8. There are a lot of other things you can read & watch.  I only read the first two, because I can't keep up with everything.

<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/" class="prominent-link">http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/</a>

Meta-blogs:

<a href="http://www.rubyinside.com" class="prominent-link">http://www.rubyinside.com</a>
<a href="http://planetrubyonrails.com/" class="prominent-link">http://planetrubyonrails.com/</a>
<a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/" class="prominent-link">http://www.rubyflow.com/</a>

Useful news on github & trending open-source repos:

<a href="https://github.com/blog" class="prominent-link">https://github.com/blog</a>

Insightful news on heroku (for example, Matz just joined Heroku!):

<a href="http://blog.heroku.com/" class="prominent-link">http://blog.heroku.com/</a>

Podcasts:

<a href="http://www.rubyshow.com/" class="prominent-link">http://www.rubyshow.com/</a>
<a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com/" class="prominent-link">http://ruby5.envylabs.com/ -- 5-minute podcasts twice a week</a>
</p>

<p>9. Some of the guides on

<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/" class="prominent-link">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/</a>

are good.  Also, sometimes there are guides on

<a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/" class="prominent-link">http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/</a>

that fill in gaps in the stable rubyonrails.org documentation.</p>

<p>10. <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/" class="post-body">Thoughtbot</a> is in Boston.  They're a highly respected rails shop.  They apparently follow this philosophy:

<a href="http://handbook.thoughtbot.com/" class="prominent-link">http://handbook.thoughtbot.com/</a></p>

<p>This is the table of contents:
<br />
<br />=== First things first:
<br />=== Vision. Competitive advantages. Customer development. Don't be a follower.
<br />
<br />=== Platform choice:
<br />=== Web apps. Mobile apps. SaaS.
<br />
<br />=== Values:
<br />=== Ambidexterity. Face time. Saying no.
<br />
<br />=== Team:
<br />=== Members. Outsourcing. Do it yourself. Hiring.
<br />
<br />=== Communication:
<br />=== Discussions. Sketches. User stories. Pair programming. Feature branch code reviews.
<br />
<br />=== Rhythm:
<br />=== Sustainable pace. Daily standups. Weekly iterations. Monthly rotations.
<br />
<br />=== Tools:
<br />=== Version control. The stack
<br />
<br />=== Design:
<br />=== What works. What doesn't work.
<br />
<br />=== Metrics:
<br />=== AARRR. A/B testing.
<br />
<br />=== Money:
<br />=== Cost. Investor lunch.
<br />
<br />=== Appendix
<br />
<br />=== Cloud services:
<br />=== Hosting. Storage. Payments. Email. Instrumentation. Process tools.
<br />
<br />=== Boston:
<br />=== Events. Designers. Developers. Investors. Lawyers.
</p>

<p>You can read the whole handbook online.</p>

<p>z) Finally, a bit about Behavior-Driven Development, and my favorite article on TDD and BDD.</p>

<p>BDD (behaviour-driven development), usually using Cucumber, is pretty popular and widely-discussed.  But where it's used, it's almost always in concert with using Rspec anyway.  Doing TDD with Rspec is considered best practice almost everywhere, and you should start there.</p>

<p>That being said, you might want to read this blog post on "Outside-In Development" (BDD with Cucumber and Rspec).  It easily demonstrates how the philosophies and tools provide different benefits.  Also, there's a bit about where not to use TDD/Rspec.

Hope this helps!
